I am contacting you regarding your NERC Grant – {{project.title}}\n\n\
\
NERC recognises the importance of preserving data of long term value generated by NERC grants. \
We receive project information directly from the NERC grants team for all projects in our subject area. \
All new projects starting are routinely considered for data management requirements by the appropriate datacentre.\n\n\
\
We at CEDA (BADC/NEODC) have reviewed your grant and surmised from the limited project \
details available that there is NO data sets of long-term value from your grant that should be \
archived at the data centre (no data of long-term archival value is not to say the project is of no value). \
However, we did not have access to the full details of your project and may have missed something.\n\n\
\
[perhaps insert some reasoning for your assessment here?]\n\n\
\
Please can you confirm that this grant will NOT produce data of long-term value that should be archived? \
Or else, if this is incorrect, let us know what data you do have? If you are unsure, the NERC Data Value \
Checklist will help you assess which data might be suitable for long term archiving: \
http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/policy/data-value-checklist.pdf. \
If you would like to discuss this with us, please do not hesitate to get in touch.\n\n\
\
Either way, please could you confirm that you are either happy with our assessment \
or would like to discuss this further sometime this week as this will help us to know \
which projects we then need to follow up on further.\n\n\
\
With best regards\n\n\

\
\nHowever, we did not have access to the full details of your project and this may be \
incomplete or inaccurate. Please can you tell us what data, if any, this grant will \
produce that is of long-term value that should be archived? If NONE, please confirm \
this- no data of long-term value is not to say the project is of no value. Please \
also indicate the current status of any data? –eg is it collected/in preparation/being \
processed/already archived somewhere else? or if you are already working with another datacentre?\n\n\
\
NERC requires a Data Management Plan (DMP) for all projects. We will use this information to \
draft one for your project and send it to you to be agreed. \
please let us know and we will be happy to discuss the next steps we should take.\n\n\

Attached is a draft Data Management Plan (DMP) for your project. Please can you review this and \
reply with comments and amendments. Once agreed we will periodically contact you (or a contact you nominate) \
to track progress and arrange ingest of the data at an appropriate time. The DMP is a living document \
and is likely to change as the project progresses.  \n\n\
