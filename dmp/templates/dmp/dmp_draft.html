<h2>Introduction/Scope </h2>
 
 
<p>The purpose of this data management plan (DMP) is to set up a coherent approach to data issues 
pertaining to {{ project.title }}. The data management objectives are to ensure that:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A high quality documented data archive is created.</li>
 <li>Appropriate data support is provided to the data users and creators.</li>
 <li>Data are made available to users in a timely fashion.</li>
 <li>Academic credit for data creation is given. </li>
 <li>Conditions of use, access and deposit are clearly stated and do not infringe on the data creators' rights.</li>
 <li>Potentially scientifically valuable data are kept for reuse in the long-term and by other disciplines.</li>
 <li>Results can be checked and validated. </li>
</ul>
 
<p>This document is an agreed record of the data management needs and issues within the project. 
It defines who is responsible for data management activities both within data centres and by the data creators. 
It lists the expected data products and provides a mechanism for recording and agreeing changes. 
Other data needs and issues are also laid out so that problems can be identified early. 
It includes conditions of use and deposit to clearly express the ownership, responsibilities 
and rights associated with the data.</p>
 
<p>The scope of this document is data management of the data used or generated by {{project.title}}.
</p>
 
<p>This data management plan has been agreed between the Data Centre and the </b>project PI ({{ project.PI }}) /programme steering committee / project management team</b>. 
Changes to the document will be recorded. In the event of dispute relating to the data the final decision rests with the NERC science programme. </p>

 
<h2> About the dataset</h2>
 
<p>The dataset encompasses all data produced by the project which is to be 
archived for posterity. This may include validated raw data, processed data and model results, 
where they have long term importance and/or use to the wider scientific community. 
The individual data sources are summarised in Appendix A.</p>
 
<h2> Roles and responsibilities</h2>
 
<h3>Data archival</h3>
NERC requires that all environmental data of long-term value generated through NERC-funded activities must be submitted to NERC for long-term management and dissemination.
<ol>
<li>It is the responsibility of the grant holder to ensure that all appropriate data and supporting metadata has been submitted to the archive before the end of the grant period.
 
 
<li>Data archival 
  <ul><li>When relevant, preliminary data should be made available to project
    collaborators as soon as possible. Any corrections or amendments to the preliminary data 
    should be announced as soon as possible. 
    <li>All validated processed data 
    (i.e. data sets in their final form) will be archived at the data centre. Archival must take 
    place no later than the end of the project funding period {{project.enddate}}.
  </ul>
<li>Ownership of the data lies with the data creator, but NERC has the right to exploit data resulting from NERC funded research.
<li>Data creators will be required to agree to the data deposit conditions before 
the data are added to the archive.
 
 
<table BGCOLOR='lightgrey' align='center' width="70%">
<tr><td  style='font-size:larger'><b>Deposit Conditions</b></td></tr>
<tr><td ><ol>
<li>The depositor confirms that he/she is the owner of the data and/or has the 
right to deposit the data in the CEDA archive</li>
<li>Ownership of the data remains with the data creator, but NERC has the right 
to exploit data resulting from NERC funded research</li>
<li>NERC reserves the right to store the data, and make the data available under 
the Conditions of Use</li>
<li>The depositor grants NERC permission to, without changing content, translate the data to 
any medium or format for the purpose of future preservation and accessibility</li>
</ol>
</td></tr>

<h3>Data distribution</h3>
<p>
To protect the research process NERC will allow those who undertake NERC-funded work a period to work exclusively on, and publish the results of, 
the data they have collected.  Access to all data submitted to the data centre will be restricted to project
participants for <b>[MAX 2 YEARS]</b> years following the data production date, after which they will be released 
into the public domain. During the embargo period, access may be extended to external 
collaborators who have been authorised by the PI or their delegated authority. 
Potential users of the archive will be required to agree to the Conditions of Use.</p>
 
<table BGCOLOR='lightgrey' align='center' width="70%" >
<tr><td  style='font-size:larger'><b>Conditions of use</b></td></tr>
<tr><td ><ol>
<li>Access to all data submitted to the {{proj.title}} archive will be restricted 
to project participants for a <b>[MAX 2 YEARS]</b> embargo, after which
they will be released into the public domain under the 
<a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/">Open Government Licence</a>.</li>
<li>Whilst the data are restricted from the public domain, no data should be transferred 
to a third party without the originator's consent.</li>
<li>Whilst the data are restricted from the public domain, all investigators have the 
right to refuse that their work, whether measurement or calculation, be used in a 
publication or presentation prior to the investigators' own publication of that work.</li>
<li>If measurements or model results from other groups within the programme are used in 
a project participant's publication during or after the programme, 
joint authorship must be offered. </li>
<li>In all cases where the data are used in a presentation or publication, a citation must be given. Users should
	refer to the appropriate dataset page in the CEDA Data Catalogue (http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk)
	for the specific citation to use. For example, "British Antarctic Survey (2008): British Antarctic Survey:
	high resolution radiosonde data from Halley and Rothera stations. NCAS British Atmospheric Data Centre,
	date of citation. http://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/37f2bef57e28bcd780a5cbfe077f4bf8 "
	Further details on data citation are available at: http://www.ceda.ac.uk/help/users-guide/citing-data/
 </li>
<li>Information submitted in application for access to the data will be made available 
to the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and its delegated authorities, 
i.e. the PI, CEDA and their host organisation,
the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) for the purposes of tracking data usage 
and of improving the service. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Publication</h3>
<p>Results coming out of the project will be published in the usual way. 
It is each investigator's responsibility to ensure that the data used in publications are the 
best available at that time.</p>
<p>During the embargo period, each investigator will have the right to refuse the use of his 
results in a publication or a presentation prior to the investigator's own publication of 
that work. If measurements or model results from other groups within the programme are used in 
a project participant's publication during or after the programme, joint authorship 
must be offered. This will not necessarily have to be accepted, particularly in cases 
where due credit and acknowledgement can be given in other, possibly more appropriate, 
ways. References of publications should be communicated to the data centre so that they can be 
integrated into the archive documentation.</p>
 
<h3>Access to third party data</h3>
<p>Third-party data required for the development of the programme activities and held at 
CEDA, such as Envisat, ECMWF and Met Office data sets, will be made available
to the participants, subject to current access conditions.</p>
<p>If required and depending on available resources, the data centre 
will endeavour to retrieve data sets 
from other sources at no cost or will negotiate their acquisition at the best possible cost.</p>
<p>A summary of third party data required by the project is given in Appendix B.</p>
 
<h3>Communication between the data centre and project participants</h3>
<p>A dataset catalogue record  will be set up at data centre. This will be the 
gateway to all project data and metadata, and to all relevant information and links. 
The web page will be the primary source of information regarding the data archive 
and will be updated as new information is available. </p> 
 
<h3>Support to scientists</h3>
The data centre will provide assistance with format and metadata issues, 
as well as a helpdesk to handle queries from data users and providers. 
 
<h3>Archive Location, Security and Backup</h3> 
<p>The archive will be located in the Centre of Environmental Data Archival (CEDA)
	at STFC (Science and Technology Facilities Council). Data will be stored online
and accessible to users as per the conditions of use stated above. Data will be curated
	and backed up according to current data centre practices</p>
 
<h2>Data Generation Activities</h2>
<p>{{project.data_activities}}</p>
	</p>
<p>The individual data sources are summarised in Appendix A.</p>
 
<h2> In-Project Data Management Approach</h2>

<p>Until the data are supplied to the data centre, the project team are responsible for storing the collected data securely. General advice includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>	Keep updated anti-virus protection on every computer. </li>
<li>	Use appropriate descriptive file names to avoid over-writing or mixing up results.</li>
<li>	Record all relevant metadata at the same time as the data - it can be hard to remember specifics after the event.</li>
<li>	Record the original creation date and time for files on your systems. </li>
<li>	Version control -  keep track of authorship and changes made to data files. </li>
<li>	Lab notebooks should be stored in a safe place.</li>
<li>	Data files should be backed up regularly and the backup data stored in a secure place physically removed from the original data.</li>
<li>	Samples should be appropriately saved so they will not degrade over time.</li>
</ul> 
 
 
 
<h2> Metadata and Documentation</h2>
 
<h3>Information on the data</h3>
<p>Metadata (i.e. information on the data) are a crucial part of any data archive since 
they ensure the discoverability, accessibility and readability of the data. It is therefore essential 
that metadata be submitted at the same time as the data sets to which they pertain. 
Metadata describing any project data not archived at the data centre should also 
be supplied to the data centre. Metadata for NetCDF files should comply with the 
Climate Forecasting (CF) convention as far as possible. Metadata requirements are 
documented here: http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/help/metadata/.
In addition to these metadata, investigators are encouraged to archive all relevant 
information, including model and experiment descriptions, references, papers, reports, etc. 
These will be added to the CEDA document repository. </p>
 
<h2> Data Quality</h2>
<p>Data should normally be submitted to the data centre ready to archive and the quality level 
indicated within the data or accompanying metadata. </p>
<p>The CEDA encourages data suppliers to follow the CEDA file name convention whenever
possible. Details on the CEDA filename convention are available at http://www.ceda.ac.uk/help/users-guide/filenames</p>
 
 
<p>In order to facilitate future data use, and unless this is inappropriate for particular 
cases (such as the widespread use of a specific format by a specialised community), 
NetCDF will be adopted for all the processed data generated by the programme. 
Documentation on this format is available here: http://www.ceda.ac.uk/help/users-guide/file-formats</p>
